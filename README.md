A very simple unfinished two player poker game.

Completed hands:
* Royal Flush
* Straight Flush
* Four of a Kind
* Full House
* Flush
* Straight

Incomplete hands:
* Three of a Kind
* Two Pair
* One Pair

Issue:
* The game lags at the beginning but is fine after the first hands are dealt.
  This is probably because of the straight.py file, which is very long.

Feel free to modify and/or complete this program.
