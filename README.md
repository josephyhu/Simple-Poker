A very simple player vs. computer poker game.

Issues:
* The game lags at the beginning but is fine after the first hands are dealt.
  This is probably because of the straight.py file.
* One pair hands don't count because the game lags too much.
  However, one_pair.py file has been provided.
* The game doesn't take into account different card rankings.
  (e.g., if both are dealt straights, the game will end in a draw.)

Feel free to modify this program.
