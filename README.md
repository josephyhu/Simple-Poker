Update: Added a scoring system.

A very simple almost finished player vs. computer poker game.

Completed hands:
* Royal Flush
* Straight Flush
* Four of a Kind
* Full House
* Flush
* Straight
* Three of a Kind
* Two Pair

Incomplete hands:
* One Pair

Issues:
* The game lags at the beginning but is fine after the first hands are dealt.
  This is probably because of the straight.py file, which is very long.
* The game doesn't take into account different card rankings.
  (e.g., if both are dealt straights, the game will end in a draw.)

Feel free to modify and/or complete this program.
